SignSense: Real-Time Sign Language Detection
This project, SignSense, focuses on bridging communication barriers for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community through an innovative Sign Language Detection System. Developed using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow, the system leverages advanced computer vision techniques and deep learning models to translate sign language gestures into text or speech in real-time.
Key Features:
Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Utilizes a webcam to capture and process hand gestures dynamically.
Deep Learning Integration: Implements Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for accurate temporal sequence analysis of gestures.
Multi-Language Support: Designed to recognize multiple sign languages, including American Sign Language (ASL).
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for seamless interaction, suitable for users of all ages and technical backgrounds.
Practical Applications: Ideal for educational institutions, workplaces, and public services to promote inclusivity and accessibility.
Methodology:
Data Collection & Preprocessing:
Captures video input using OpenCV and extracts key landmarks (face, pose, hands) with MediaPipe.
Processes data into feature vectors for training.
Model Training:
Trains an LSTM-based deep learning model using annotated datasets of sign language gestures.
Optimized with techniques like dropout layers, batch normalization, and hyperparameter tuning.
Real-Time Detection & Visualization:
Integrates the trained model to predict gestures in live video streams.
Displays recognized gestures with visual overlays and text annotations.
Results:
The system achieves high accuracy in recognizing a variety of gestures, validated through rigorous testing using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. It demonstrates robust performance in controlled environments with potential for real-world deployment.
Future Scope:
Expand gesture vocabulary to include complex phrases.
Support additional sign languages with localized adaptations.
Enhance model performance using advanced architectures like Transformers or 3D CNNs.
Integrate with assistive technologies such as AR/VR interfaces or smart devices.
